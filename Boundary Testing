We have to test a text field (password) which accepts the length between 6-12 characters.

Minimum boundary value is 6

Maximum boundary value is 12

Valid text length is 6, 7, 11, 12

Invalid text length is 5, 13

Test case 1: Text length of 5 (min-1) = Invalid

Test case 2: Text length of exactly 6 (min) = Valid

Test case 3: Text length of 7 (min+1) = Valid


Test case 4: Text length of 11 (max-1) = Valid

Test case 5: Text length of exactly 12 (max) = Valid

Test case 6: Text length of 13 (max+1) = Invalid
